## Running the program

Run the [<b>v4(main).py</b>](https://github.com/mehulverma26/Mechanics-of-search-assignment-2/blob/main/v4%20(main).py) because that is most up to date code but I am including earlier versions of the code just in case anyone wants to study or take a reference from them otherwise it will be reminder for my journey leading up to the finalized version ðŸ˜Š
